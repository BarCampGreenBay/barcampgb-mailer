Hi %recipient_name%,

Big news! Thanks to our generous sponsors, we'll be able to provide a free dinner this year! Now you can stick around all day!

Also, you may have noticed I have a slightly different email address: info@mg.barcampgb.org. Don't ask why :P

If for some reason you haven't registered yet, you'd better do it before October 19 to get a free t-shirt. We have an awesome new design this year! If you can't come, I'll be sad, but I would also appreciate if you could help spread the word.

Thanks!
