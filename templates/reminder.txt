Hi %recipient_name%,

BarCamp Green Bay 2016 is only a week away!

The opening session starts at 10am sharp so you might want to arrive a little bit earlier to sign in and grab some free snacks.

If you registered before October 10, we'll have a free t-shirt waiting for you as well :)

You can park in lot F and enter through 5B. Here's a handy map: https://www.nwtc.edu/NWTC/media/cted/corporate-conference-center-map.pdf

See you there!
