Hi %recipient_name%,

BarCamp Green Bay 2015 is only a week away!

The opening session starts at 9am sharp so you might want to arrive a little bit earlier to sign in and grab some free snacks.

If you registered before October 10, we'll have a free t-shirt waiting for you as well :)

Here's a handy map for parking: http://www.nwtc.edu/academics/training_and_cont_ed/conferences/Documents/corporate-conference-center-map.pdf

See you there!
