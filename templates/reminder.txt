Hi %recipient_name%,

BarCamp Green Bay 2015 is less than a week away!

The opening session starts at 9am sharp so you might want to arrive a little bit earlier to sign in and grab some coffee and doughnuts.

If you registered before October 19, we'll have a free t-shirt waiting for you as well :)

Here's a handy map for Corportate Conference Center parking: https://www.nwtc.edu/NWTC/media/cted/corporate-conference-center-map.pdf

See you there!
